# UnicornAttractor
Stream 3 project
This project was created using django in pycharm

I used existing files which had been created by following the insructions on code institute so create a unicorn attractor project, 
an accounts app, profile, register and login page, along with a products page and cart. I then created a new repository in github and added 
the project to it.
