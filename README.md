# UnicornAttractor
Stream 3 project
This project was created using django in pycharm. It is a lighthearted project created following the instructions for the final project for stream 3. It invites users to create bugs for free, but promts them to register and make a one-off payment in order to create features. The checkout app uses stripe and its inbuilt functionality to process payments.

I used existing apps which had been created by following the insructions on code institute to create a unicorn attractor project. The following apps were reused;

accounts
register
login
products
cart
checkout

Next I created a home app to create the home page with links to 'bugs' and 'features', which I also created. Note that users need to login or register in order to create features. 

Finally, I deployed the project to python anywhere.
